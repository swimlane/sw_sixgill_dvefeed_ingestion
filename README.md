# Cybersixgill DVE Feed Ingestion

The Cybersixgill Dynamic Vulnerability Exploit (DVE) Score is based on the most comprehensive collection of vulnerability-related threat intelligence and is the only solution that provides users total context and predicts the immediate risks of a vulnerability based on threat actorsâ€™ intent. With seamless integration, Swimlane customers can track threats from DVEs that most others define as irrelevant and have a higher probability of being exploited directly from the Swimlane dashboard.
